## üß© Key OOP Concepts Used

| Concept             | Implementation |
|---------------------|----------------|
| **Encapsulation**   | Fields in `Product`, `Cart`, `Customer` are private/protected |
| **Inheritance**     | Specialized products like `shippable`and `nonshippable` extend base `Product` |
| **Interfaces**      | `Shippable` defines `getName()` and `getWeight()` for shipping and  `expiryDate` defines `getExpiryDate()` |
| **Composition**     | `Cart` has a list of `Product` items |

## üèóÔ∏è Class Overview

| Class / Interface | Description |
|-------------------|-------------|
| `Product`         | Base class for all products (name, price) |
| `nonShippableProductwithExpiry`          | class for nonshippable product which has expiryDate |
| `ShippableProductwithExpiry`          | class for shippable product which has expiryDate |
| `ShippablewithoutExpiry`          | class for shippable product which has no expiryDate |
| `Cart`            | Holds products and calculates totals |
| `Customer`        | Represents a user with a balance,name and cart |
| `Shippable` (interface) | Implemented by products that can be shipped |
| `expiryDate` (interface) | Implemented by products that have can be expried |
| `ShippingService` | Accepts a list of `shippable` objects and processes shipping |
| `test`            | Demonstrates usage and checkout flow |
